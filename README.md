 **Executive summary (1-2 paragraphs)**

    Local Roasters is a location based, personalized coffee experience.     begin by selecting their coffee preferences(taste, blend, origin, fair trade), price range(such as avg per cup) and more gathering an overall measurement of how they like their coffee. Once the user goes through their preferences and signs up they get greeted by the dashboard. The dashboard display's few local shops that match their preferences, and another section will preview coffee for sale locally or online (ie on amazon)  that they may like and meet their price preferences.

    Local Roaster will allow users to:

    - Check-In: Users will be able to "Check-in" to coffee shops and rate the specific coffee they had
    - "Review": User's may choose a quick response to a feedback prompt that will be limited to ratings by "beans" for overall coffee experience, caffeine and flavors.
        - A section on a shop's page will exist for price updates, bean and roast data to be corrected.
    - Preferences: Users can add/update favorite stores, beans,  coffee drinks.

    Describe your full stack web application idea. Answer the following questions to help you describe your application idea:

    - What does the application do?

    Local Roasters allows coffee drinkers to customize their coffee drinking experience.

    - What is the motivation for your application?

    Brooklyn's coffee shops have a variety of artisanal  coffee shops, some charing $5 for a 16 oz cup of coffee and some for $2. Often times the price of the coffee is not an indicator of the quality, freshness and taste. 

    - Who would use this application?

    Unfortunately, many Brooklyn locals like myself don't have a way of weeding out the coffee shops that serve coffee I like at my price than the ones that don't. In fact many nice places, have the worst coffee!

    - Is there a *need* or *want* in the market that it fulfills (*does not have to be a for-profit, or paid need*)?

    There is a want in the market for a way to customize your coffee-going experience.
